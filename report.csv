                packaging is derived.
                If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at

        </div>
        <div class=""content_section_text"">
          <p>
                Ubuntu's Apache2 default configuration is different from the
                upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
                interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is
                <b>fully documented in
                /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz</b>. Refer to this for the full
                documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
                found by accessing the <a href=""/manual"">manual</a> if the <tt>apache2-doc</tt>
                package was installed on this server.

          </p>
          <p>
                The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows:
          </p>
          <pre>
/etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|       `--  ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled
|       |-- *.load
|       `-- *.conf
|-- conf-enabled

                           file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
                           files when starting up the web server.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                           <tt>ports.conf</tt> is always included from the
                           main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
                           incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.
                        </li>

                        <li>

                           <tt>conf-enabled/</tt> and <tt>sites-enabled/</tt> directories contain
                           particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
                           fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.

remote target and Nessus did not log any subsequent errors or failures
for the authentication protocol.

When possible, Nessus tracks errors or failures related to otherwise
valid credentials in order to highlight issues that may result in
incomplete scan results or limited scan coverage. The types of issues
that are tracked include errors that indicate that the account used
for scanning did not have sufficient permissions for a particular
check, intermittent protocol failures which are unexpected after the
protocol has been negotiated successfully earlier in the scan, and
intermittent authentication failures which are unexpected after a
credential set has been accepted as valid earlier in the scan. This
plugin reports when none of the above issues have been logged during
the course of the scan for at least one authenticated protocol. See
plugin output for details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  issues to be encountered for one protocol and not another.
  For example, authentication to the SSH service on the
  remote target may have consistently succeeded with no
  privilege errors encountered, while connections to the SMB
  service on the remote target may have failed
  intermittently.

- Resolving logged issues for all available authentication
  protocols may improve scan coverage, but the value of
  resolving each issue for a particular protocol may vary
  from target to target depending upon what data (if any) is
  gathered from the target via that protocol and what
  particular check failed. For example, consistently
  successful checks via SSH are more critical for Linux
  targets than for Windows targets, and likewise
  consistently successful checks via SMB are more critical
  for Windows targets than for Linux targets.","n/a","","

  - Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant
    code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead
    of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor
    present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used
    then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery
    during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability
    to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present
    are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because
    explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL
    1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s). (CVE-2019-1547)

  - There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit
    moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime
    RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed
    likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have
    to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low
    level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e (Affected
    1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2u (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t). (CVE-2019-1551)

  - In situations where an attacker receives automated notification of the success or failure of a decryption
    attempt an attacker, after sending a very large number of messages to be decrypted, can recover a
    CMS/PKCS7 transported encryption key or decrypt any RSA encrypted message that was encrypted with the
    public RSA key, using a Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack. Applications are not affected if they use a
    certificate together with the private RSA key to the CMS_decrypt or PKCS7_decrypt functions to select the
    correct recipient info to decrypt. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL
    1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s). (CVE-2019-1563)

  - The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to
    compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In
    such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent
    over that TLS connection. The attack can only be exploited if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across
    multiple TLS connections. Note that this issue only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites.

    to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low
    level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e (Affected
    1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2u (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t). (CVE-2019-1551)

  - In situations where an attacker receives automated notification of the success or failure of a decryption
    attempt an attacker, after sending a very large number of messages to be decrypted, can recover a
    CMS/PKCS7 transported encryption key or decrypt any RSA encrypted message that was encrypted with the
    public RSA key, using a Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack. Applications are not affected if they use a
    certificate together with the private RSA key to the CMS_decrypt or PKCS7_decrypt functions to select the
    correct recipient info to decrypt. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL
    1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s). (CVE-2019-1563)

  - The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to
    compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In
    such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent
    over that TLS connection. The attack can only be exploited if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across
    multiple TLS connections. Note that this issue only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites.
    This issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. OpenSSL
    1.1.1 is not vulnerable to this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2w (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2v). (CVE-2020-1968)

successful because the authentication protocol service was available

protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of

protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that

    (CVE-2020-14314)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc4. A failure of the file system metadata validator in
    XFS can cause an inode with a valid, user-creatable extended attribute to be flagged as corrupt. This can
    lead to the filesystem being shutdown, or otherwise rendered inaccessible until it is remounted, leading
    to a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
    (CVE-2020-14385)

  - A race condition between hugetlb sysctl handlers in mm/hugetlb.c in the Linux kernel before 5.8.8 could be
    used by local attackers to corrupt memory, cause a NULL pointer dereference, or possibly have unspecified
    other impact, aka CID-17743798d812. (CVE-2020-25285)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of biovecs in versions before 5.9-rc7. A zero-length
    biovec request issued by the block subsystem could cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop, causing a
    denial of service. This flaw allows a local attacker with basic privileges to issue requests to a block
    device, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system
    availability. (CVE-2020-25641)

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL
v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

A padding oracle flaw was found in the Secure Sockets Layer version
2.0 (SSLv2) protocol. An attacker can potentially use this flaw to
decrypt RSA-encrypted cipher text from a connection using a newer
SSL/TLS protocol version, allowing them to decrypt such connections.
This cross-protocol attack is publicly referred to as DROWN.
(CVE-2016-0800)

Note: This issue was addressed by disabling the SSLv2 protocol by
default when using the 'SSLv23' connection methods, and removing
support for weak SSLv2 cipher suites. For more information, refer to
the knowledge base article linked to in the References section.

A flaw was found in the way malicious SSLv2 clients could negotiate
SSLv2 ciphers that have been disabled on the server. This could result
in weak SSLv2 ciphers being used for SSLv2 connections, making them
vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2015-3197)

A side-channel attack was found that makes use of cache-bank conflicts
on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture. An attacker who has the
ability to control code in a thread running on the same hyper-threaded
core as the victim's thread that is performing decryption, could use
this flaw to recover RSA private keys. (CVE-2016-0702)

A double-free flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed certain
malformed DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) private keys. An attacker
could create specially crafted DSA private keys that, when processed
by an application compiled against OpenSSL, could cause the
application to crash. (CVE-2016-0705)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a NULL pointer dereference or a
heap-based memory corruption, was found in the way some BIGNUM
functions of OpenSSL were implemented. Applications that use these
functions with large untrusted input could crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0797)

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL
v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

A padding oracle flaw was found in the Secure Sockets Layer version
2.0 (SSLv2) protocol. An attacker can potentially use this flaw to
decrypt RSA-encrypted cipher text from a connection using a newer
SSL/TLS protocol version, allowing them to decrypt such connections.
This cross-protocol attack is publicly referred to as DROWN.
(CVE-2016-0800)

Note: This issue was addressed by disabling the SSLv2 protocol by
default when using the 'SSLv23' connection methods, and removing
support for weak SSLv2 cipher suites. For more information, refer to
the knowledge base article linked to in the References section.

A flaw was found in the way malicious SSLv2 clients could negotiate
SSLv2 ciphers that have been disabled on the server. This could result
in weak SSLv2 ciphers being used for SSLv2 connections, making them
vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2015-3197)

A side-channel attack was found that makes use of cache-bank conflicts
on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture. An attacker who has the
ability to control code in a thread running on the same hyper-threaded
core as the victim's thread that is performing decryption, could use
this flaw to recover RSA private keys. (CVE-2016-0702)

A double-free flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed certain
malformed DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) private keys. An attacker
could create specially crafted DSA private keys that, when processed
by an application compiled against OpenSSL, could cause the
application to crash. (CVE-2016-0705)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a NULL pointer dereference or a
heap-based memory corruption, was found in the way some BIGNUM
functions of OpenSSL were implemented. Applications that use these
functions with large untrusted input could crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0797)

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version:
MariaDB (5.5.47). Refer to the MariaDB Release Notes listed in the
References section for a complete list of changes.

Security Fix(es) :

* It was found that the MariaDB client library did not properly check
host names against server identities noted in the X.509 certificates
when establishing secure connections using TLS/SSL. A
man-in-the-middle attacker could possibly use this flaw to impersonate
a server to a client. (CVE-2016-2047)

section for a complete list of changes.

Security Fix(es) :

* Multiple flaws were found in Samba's DCE/RPC protocol
implementation. A remote, authenticated attacker could use these flaws
to cause a denial of service against the Samba server (high CPU load
or a crash) or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions
of the user running Samba (root). This flaw could also be used to
downgrade a secure DCE/RPC connection by a man-in-the-middle attacker
taking control of an Active Directory (AD) object and compromising the
security of a Samba Active Directory Domain Controller (DC).
(CVE-2015-5370)

Note: While Samba packages as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux do
not support running Samba as an AD DC, this flaw applies to all roles
Samba implements.

* A protocol flaw, publicly referred to as Badlock, was found in the
Security Account Manager Remote Protocol (MS-SAMR) and the Local
Security Authority (Domain Policy) Remote Protocol (MS-LSAD). Any
authenticated DCE/RPC connection that a client initiates against a
server could be used by a man-in-the-middle attacker to impersonate
the authenticated user against the SAMR or LSA service on the server.
As a result, the attacker would be able to get read/write access to
the Security Account Manager database, and use this to reveal all
passwords or any other potentially sensitive information in that
database. (CVE-2016-2118)

* Several flaws were found in Samba's implementation of NTLMSSP
authentication. An unauthenticated, man-in-the-middle attacker could
use this flaw to clear the encryption and integrity flags of a
connection, causing data to be transmitted in plain text. The attacker
could also force the client or server into sending data in plain text
even if encryption was explicitly requested for that connection.
(CVE-2016-2110)

* It was discovered that Samba configured as a Domain Controller would
establish a secure communication channel with a machine using a
spoofed computer name. A remote attacker able to observe network
traffic could use this flaw to obtain session-related information
about the spoofed machine. (CVE-2016-2111)

* It was found that Samba's LDAP implementation did not enforce
integrity protection for LDAP connections. A man-in-the-middle
attacker could use this flaw to downgrade LDAP connections to use no
integrity protection, allowing them to hijack such connections.
(CVE-2016-2112)

* It was found that Samba did not validate SSL/TLS certificates in
certain connections. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw
to spoof a Samba server using a specially crafted SSL/TLS certificate.
(CVE-2016-2113)

* It was discovered that Samba did not enforce Server Message Block
(SMB) signing for clients using the SMB1 protocol. A man-in-the-middle
attacker could use this flaw to modify traffic between a client and a
server. (CVE-2016-2114)

* It was found that Samba did not enable integrity protection for IPC
traffic by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw
to view and modify the data sent between a Samba server and a client.
(CVE-2016-2115)

issues. Upstream acknowledges Jouni Knuutinen (Synopsis) as the

Samba (4.2.10). Refer to the Release Notes listed in the References
section for a complete list of changes.

Security Fix(es) :

* Multiple flaws were found in Samba's DCE/RPC protocol
implementation. A remote, authenticated attacker could use these flaws
to cause a denial of service against the Samba server (high CPU load
or a crash) or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions
of the user running Samba (root). This flaw could also be used to
downgrade a secure DCE/RPC connection by a man-in-the-middle attacker
taking control of an Active Directory (AD) object and compromising the
security of a Samba Active Directory Domain Controller (DC).
(CVE-2015-5370)

Note: While Samba packages as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux do
not support running Samba as an AD DC, this flaw applies to all roles
Samba implements.

* A protocol flaw, publicly referred to as Badlock, was found in the
Security Account Manager Remote Protocol (MS-SAMR) and the Local
Security Authority (Domain Policy) Remote Protocol (MS-LSAD). Any
authenticated DCE/RPC connection that a client initiates against a
server could be used by a man-in-the-middle attacker to impersonate
the authenticated user against the SAMR or LSA service on the server.
As a result, the attacker would be able to get read/write access to
the Security Account Manager database, and use this to reveal all
passwords or any other potentially sensitive information in that
database. (CVE-2016-2118)

* Several flaws were found in Samba's implementation of NTLMSSP
authentication. An unauthenticated, man-in-the-middle attacker could
use this flaw to clear the encryption and integrity flags of a
connection, causing data to be transmitted in plain text. The attacker
could also force the client or server into sending data in plain text
even if encryption was explicitly requested for that connection.
(CVE-2016-2110)

* It was discovered that Samba configured as a Domain Controller would
establish a secure communication channel with a machine using a
spoofed computer name. A remote attacker able to observe network
traffic could use this flaw to obtain session-related information
about the spoofed machine. (CVE-2016-2111)

* It was found that Samba's LDAP implementation did not enforce
integrity protection for LDAP connections. A man-in-the-middle
attacker could use this flaw to downgrade LDAP connections to use no
integrity protection, allowing them to hijack such connections.
(CVE-2016-2112)

* It was found that Samba did not validate SSL/TLS certificates in
certain connections. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw
to spoof a Samba server using a specially crafted SSL/TLS certificate.
(CVE-2016-2113)

* It was discovered that Samba did not enforce Server Message Block
(SMB) signing for clients using the SMB1 protocol. A man-in-the-middle
attacker could use this flaw to modify traffic between a client and a
server. (CVE-2016-2114)

* It was found that Samba did not enable integrity protection for IPC
traffic by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw
to view and modify the data sent between a Samba server and a client.
(CVE-2016-2115)

issues. Upstream acknowledges Jouni Knuutinen (Synopsis) as the
original reporter of CVE-2015-5370; and Stefan Metzmacher (SerNet) as

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as a
full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.

Security Fix(es) :

* A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL encoded certain ASN.1 data
structures. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially
crafted certificate which, when verified or re-encoded by OpenSSL,
could cause it to crash, or execute arbitrary code using the
permissions of the user running an application compiled against the
OpenSSL library. (CVE-2016-2108)

* Two integer overflow flaws, leading to buffer overflows, were found
in the way the EVP_EncodeUpdate() and EVP_EncryptUpdate() functions of
OpenSSL parsed very large amounts of input data. A remote attacker
could use these flaws to crash an application using OpenSSL or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running that application. (CVE-2016-2105, CVE-2016-2106)

* It was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when
decrypting TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when the
connection used the AES CBC cipher suite and the server supported
AES-NI. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve
plain text from encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as
a padding oracle. (CVE-2016-2107)

* Several flaws were found in the way BIO_*printf functions were
implemented in OpenSSL. Applications which passed large amounts of
untrusted data through these functions could crash or potentially
execute code with the permissions of the user running such an
application. (CVE-2016-0799, CVE-2016-2842)

* A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed certain
ASN.1-encoded data from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. An
application using OpenSSL that accepts untrusted ASN.1 BIO input could
be forced to allocate an excessive amount of data. (CVE-2016-2109)

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security
impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each
vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as a
full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.

Security Fix(es) :

* A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL encoded certain ASN.1 data
structures. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially
crafted certificate which, when verified or re-encoded by OpenSSL,
could cause it to crash, or execute arbitrary code using the
permissions of the user running an application compiled against the
OpenSSL library. (CVE-2016-2108)

* Two integer overflow flaws, leading to buffer overflows, were found
in the way the EVP_EncodeUpdate() and EVP_EncryptUpdate() functions of
OpenSSL parsed very large amounts of input data. A remote attacker
could use these flaws to crash an application using OpenSSL or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running that application. (CVE-2016-2105, CVE-2016-2106)

* It was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when
decrypting TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when the
connection used the AES CBC cipher suite and the server supported
AES-NI. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve
plain text from encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as
a padding oracle. (CVE-2016-2107)

* Several flaws were found in the way BIO_*printf functions were
implemented in OpenSSL. Applications which passed large amounts of
untrusted data through these functions could crash or potentially
execute code with the permissions of the user running such an
application. (CVE-2016-0799, CVE-2016-2842)

* A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed certain
ASN.1-encoded data from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. An
application using OpenSSL that accepts untrusted ASN.1 BIO input could
be forced to allocate an excessive amount of data. (CVE-2016-2109)

Security Fix(es) :

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's ASN.1 DER decoder
processed certain certificate files with tags of indefinite length. A
local, unprivileged user could use a specially crafted X.509
certificate DER file to crash the system or, potentially, escalate
their privileges on the system. (CVE-2016-0758, Important)

Red Hat would like to thank Philip Pettersson of Samsung for reporting
this issue.

Bug Fix(es) :

* Under certain conditions, the migration threads could race with the
CPU hotplug, which could cause a deadlock. A set of patches has been
provided to fix this bug, and the deadlock no longer occurs in the
system. (BZ# 1299338)

* A bug in the code that cleans up revoked delegations could
previously cause a soft lockup in the NFS server. This patch fixes the
underlying source code, so the lockup no longer occurs. (BZ#1311582)

* The second attempt to reload Common Application Programming
Interface (CAPI) devices on the little-endian variant of IBM Power
Systems previously failed. The provided set of patches fixes this bug,
and reloading works as intended. (BZ#1312396)

* Due to inconsistencies in page size of IOMMU, the NVMe device, and
the kernel, the BUG_ON signal previously occurred in the
nvme_setup_prps() function, leading to the system crash while setting
up the DMA transfer. The provided patch sets the default NVMe page
size to 4k, thus preventing the system crash. (BZ#1312399)

* Previously, on a system using the Infiniband mlx5 driver used for
the SRP stack, a hard lockup previously occurred after the kernel
exceeded time with lock held with interrupts blocked. As a
consequence, the system panicked. This update fixes this bug, and the
system no longer panics in this situation. (BZ#1313814)

* On the little-endian variant of IBM Power Systems, the kernel
previously crashed in the bitmap_weight() function while running the
memory affinity script. The provided patch fortifies the topology
setup and prevents sd-> child from being set to NULL when it is
already NULL. As a result, the memory affinity script runs
successfully. (BZ#1316158)

* When a KVM guest wrote random values to the special-purpose
registers (SPR) Instruction Authority Mask Register (IAMR), the guest
and the corresponding QEMU process previously hung. This update adds
the code which sets SPRs to a suitable neutral value on guest exit,
thus fixing this bug. (BZ#1316636)

* Under heavy iSCSI traffic load, the system previously panicked due
to a race in the locking code leading to a list corruption. This
update fixes this bug, and the system no longer panics in this
situation. (BZ#1316812)

* During SCSI exception handling (triggered by some irregularities),
the driver could previously use an already retired SCSI command. As a
consequence, a kernel panic or data corruption occurred. The provided
patches fix this bug, and exception handling now proceeds
successfully. (BZ #1316820)

* When the previously opened /dev/tty, which pointed to a pseudo
terminal (pty) pair, was the last file closed, a kernel crash could
previously occur. The underlying source code has been fixed,
preventing this bug. (BZ# 1320297)

* Previously, when using VPLEX and FCoE via the bnx2fc driver,
different degrees of data corruption occurred. The provided patch
fixes the FCP Response (RSP) residual parsing in bnx2fc, which
prevents the aforementioned corruption. (BZ#1322279)","Update the affected kernel packages.","http://www.nessus.org/u?7135172c","

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux

These updated kernel packages include several security issues and
numerous bug fixes, some of which you can see below. Space precludes
documenting all of these bug fixes in this advisory. To see the
complete list of bug fixes, users are directed to the related
Knowledge Article: https://access.redhat.com/articles/2361921.

Security Fixes :

* A flaw was found in the way certain interfaces of the Linux kernel's
Infiniband subsystem used write() as bi-directional ioctl()
replacement, which could lead to insufficient memory security checks
when being invoked using the splice() system call. A local
unprivileged user on a system with either Infiniband hardware present
or RDMA Userspace Connection Manager Access module explicitly loaded,
could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2016-4565, Important)

* A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP
implementation handled sctp_accept() during the processing of
heartbeat timeout events. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
prevent further connections to be accepted by the SCTP server running
on the system, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-8767,
Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Jann Horn for reporting CVE-2016-4565.

Bug Fixes :

* When Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) devices were removed or
deleted, a system crash could occur due to a race condition between
listing all SCSI devices and SCSI device removal. The provided patch
ensures that the starting node for the klist_iter_init_node() function
is actually a member of the list before using it. As a result, a
system crash no longer occurs in the described scenario. (BZ#1333403)

* This update offers a reworked series of patches for the resizable
hash table (rhashtable) including a number of backported bug fixes and
enhancements from upstream. (BZ#1328801)

* Previously, the same value of the mperf Model-Specific Register
(MSR) read twice in a row could lead to a kernel panic due to the
divide-by-zero error. The provided patch fixes this bug, and the
kernel now handles two identical values of mperf gracefully.
(BZ#1334438)

* When a transparent proxy application was running and the number of
established connections on the computer exceeded one million,
unrelated processes, such as curl or ssh, were unable to bind to a
local IP on the box to initiate a connection. The provided patch fixes
the cooperation of the REUSEADDR/NOREUSEADDR socket option, and thus
prevents the local port from being exhausted. As a result, the
aforementioned bug no longer occurs in the described scenario.
(BZ#1323960)

* Previously, the kernel support for non-local bind for the IPv6
protocol was incomplete. As a consequence, an attempt to bind a socket
to an IPv6 address that is not assigned to the host could fail. The
provided patch includes changes in the ip_nonlocal_bind variable,
which is now set to allow binding to an IPv6 address that is not
assigned to the host. As a result, Linux servers are now able to bind
to non-local IPv6 addresses as expected. (BZ#1324502)

* On some servers with a faster CPU, USB initialization could
previously lead to a kernel hang during boot. If this inconvenience
occurred when booting the second kernel during the kdump operation,
the kdump service failed and the vmcore was lost. The provided
upstream patch fixes this bug, and the kernel no longer hangs after
USB initialization. (BZ#1327581)

These updated kernel packages include several security issues and
numerous bug fixes, some of which you can see below. Space precludes
documenting all of these bug fixes in this advisory. To see the
complete list of bug fixes, users are directed to the related
Knowledge Article: https://access.redhat.com/articles/2460971.

Security Fix(es) :

* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's keyring handling code, where
in key_reject_and_link() an uninitialised variable would eventually
lead to arbitrary free address which could allow attacker to use a
use-after-free style attack. (CVE-2016-4470, Important)

* The ovl_setattr function in fs/overlayfs/inode.c in the Linux kernel
through 4.3.3 attempts to merge distinct setattr operations, which
allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and modify
the attributes of arbitrary overlay files via a crafted application.
(CVE-2015-8660, Moderate)

* It was reported that on s390x, the fork of a process with four page
table levels will cause memory corruption with a variety of symptoms.
All processes are created with three level page table and a limit of
4TB for the address space. If the parent process has four page table
levels with a limit of 8PB, the function that duplicates the address
space will try to copy memory areas outside of the address space limit
for the child process. (CVE-2016-2143, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Nathan Williams for reporting
CVE-2015-8660. The CVE-2016-4470 issue was discovered by David Howells
(Red Hat Inc.).

Bug Fix(es) :

* The glibc headers and the Linux headers share certain definitions of
key structures that are required to be defined in kernel and in
userspace. In some instances both userspace and sanitized kernel
headers have to be included in order to get the structure definitions
required by the user program. Unfortunately because the glibc and
Linux headers don't coordinate this can result in compilation errors.
The glibc headers have therefore been fixed to coordinate with Linux
UAPI-based headers. With the header coordination compilation errors no
longer occur. (BZ#1331285)

* When running the TCP/IPv6 traffic over the mlx4_en networking
interface on the big endian architectures, call traces reporting about
a 'hw csum failure' could occur. With this update, the mlx4_en driver
has been fixed by correction of the checksum calculation for the big
endian architectures. As a result, the call trace error no longer
appears in the log messages. (BZ#1337431)

* Under significant load, some applications such as logshifter could
generate bursts of log messages too large for the system logger to
spool. Due to a race condition, log messages from that application
could then be lost even after the log volume dropped to manageable
levels. This update fixes the kernel mechanism used to notify the
transmitter end of the socket used by the system logger that more
space is available on the receiver side, removing a race condition
which previously caused the sender to stop transmitting new messages
and allowing all log messages to be processed correctly. (BZ#1337513)

* Previously, after heavy open or close of the Accelerator Function
Unit (AFU) contexts, the interrupt packet went out and the AFU context
did not see any interrupts. Consequently, a kernel panic could occur.
The provided patch set fixes handling of the interrupt requests, and
kernel panic no longer occurs in the described situation. (BZ#1338886)

* net: recvfrom would fail on short buffer. (BZ#1339115)

* Backport rhashtable changes from upstream. (BZ#1343639)

* Server Crashing after starting Glusterd & creating volumes.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

These updated kernel packages include several security issues and
numerous bug fixes, some of which you can see below. Space precludes
documenting all of these bug fixes in this advisory. To see the
complete list of bug fixes, users are directed to the related
Knowledge Article: https://access.redhat.com/articles/2460971.

Security Fix(es) :

* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's keyring handling code, where
in key_reject_and_link() an uninitialised variable would eventually
lead to arbitrary free address which could allow attacker to use a
use-after-free style attack. (CVE-2016-4470, Important)

* The ovl_setattr function in fs/overlayfs/inode.c in the Linux kernel
through 4.3.3 attempts to merge distinct setattr operations, which
allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and modify
the attributes of arbitrary overlay files via a crafted application.
(CVE-2015-8660, Moderate)

* It was reported that on s390x, the fork of a process with four page
table levels will cause memory corruption with a variety of symptoms.
All processes are created with three level page table and a limit of
4TB for the address space. If the parent process has four page table
levels with a limit of 8PB, the function that duplicates the address
space will try to copy memory areas outside of the address space limit
for the child process. (CVE-2016-2143, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Nathan Williams for reporting
CVE-2015-8660. The CVE-2016-4470 issue was discovered by David Howells
(Red Hat Inc.).

Bug Fix(es) :

* The glibc headers and the Linux headers share certain definitions of
key structures that are required to be defined in kernel and in
userspace. In some instances both userspace and sanitized kernel
headers have to be included in order to get the structure definitions
required by the user program. Unfortunately because the glibc and
Linux headers don't coordinate this can result in compilation errors.
The glibc headers have therefore been fixed to coordinate with Linux
UAPI-based headers. With the header coordination compilation errors no
longer occur. (BZ#1331285)

* When running the TCP/IPv6 traffic over the mlx4_en networking
interface on the big endian architectures, call traces reporting about
a 'hw csum failure' could occur. With this update, the mlx4_en driver
has been fixed by correction of the checksum calculation for the big
endian architectures. As a result, the call trace error no longer
appears in the log messages. (BZ#1337431)

* Under significant load, some applications such as logshifter could
generate bursts of log messages too large for the system logger to
spool. Due to a race condition, log messages from that application
could then be lost even after the log volume dropped to manageable
levels. This update fixes the kernel mechanism used to notify the
transmitter end of the socket used by the system logger that more
space is available on the receiver side, removing a race condition
which previously caused the sender to stop transmitting new messages
and allowing all log messages to be processed correctly. (BZ#1337513)

* Previously, after heavy open or close of the Accelerator Function
Unit (AFU) contexts, the interrupt packet went out and the AFU context
did not see any interrupts. Consequently, a kernel panic could occur.
The provided patch set fixes handling of the interrupt requests, and
kernel panic no longer occurs in the described situation. (BZ#1338886)

* net: recvfrom would fail on short buffer. (BZ#1339115)

* Backport rhashtable changes from upstream. (BZ#1343639)

* Server Crashing after starting Glusterd & creating volumes.
(BZ#1344234)

* RAID5 reshape deadlock fix. (BZ#1344313)

* BDX perf uncore support fix. (BZ#1347374)","Update the affected kernel packages.","http://www.nessus.org/u?5d3cb8ad","

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security Fix(es) :

* A security flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the
mark_source_chains() function in 'net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c'. It
is possible for a user-supplied 'ipt_entry' structure to have a large
'next_offset' field. This field is not bounds checked prior to writing
to a counter value at the supplied offset. (CVE-2016-3134, Important)

* A flaw was discovered in processing setsockopt for 32 bit processes
on 64 bit systems. This flaw will allow attackers to alter arbitrary
kernel memory when unloading a kernel module. This action is usually
restricted to root-privileged users but can also be leveraged if the
kernel is compiled with CONFIG_USER_NS and CONFIG_NET_NS and the user
is granted elevated privileges. (CVE-2016-4997, Important)

* An out-of-bounds heap memory access leading to a Denial of Service,
heap disclosure, or further impact was found in setsockopt(). The
function call is normally restricted to root, however some processes
with cap_sys_admin may also be able to trigger this flaw in privileged
container environments. (CVE-2016-4998, Moderate)

Bug Fix(es) :

* In some cases, running the ipmitool command caused a kernel panic
due to a race condition in the ipmi message handler. This update fixes
the race condition, and the kernel panic no longer occurs in the
described scenario. (BZ#1353947)

* Previously, running I/O-intensive operations in some cases caused
the system to terminate unexpectedly after a NULL pointer dereference
in the kernel. With this update, a set of patches has been applied to
the 3w-9xxx and 3w-sas drivers that fix this bug. As a result, the
system no longer crashes in the described scenario. (BZ#1362040)

* Previously, the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) sockets
did not inherit the SELinux labels properly. As a consequence, the
sockets were labeled with the unlabeled_t SELinux type which caused
SCTP connections to fail. The underlying source code has been
modified, and SCTP connections now works as expected. (BZ#1354302)

* Previously, the bnx2x driver waited for transmission completions
when recovering from a parity event, which substantially increased the
recovery time. With this update, bnx2x does not wait for transmission
completion in the described circumstances. As a result, the recovery
of bnx2x after a parity event now takes less time. (BZ#1351972)

Enhancement(s) :

* With this update, the audit subsystem enables filtering of processes
by name besides filtering by PID. Users can now audit by executable
name (with the '-F exe=' option), which allows expression of many new
audit rules. This functionality can be used to create events when
specific applications perform a syscall. (BZ#1345774)

* With this update, the Nonvolatile Memory Express (NVMe) and the
multi-queue block layer (blk_mq) have been upgraded to the Linux 4.5
upstream version. Previously, a race condition between timeout and
freeing request in blk_mq occurred, which could affect the
blk_mq_tag_to_rq() function and consequently a kernel oops could
occur. The provided patch fixes this race condition by updating the
tags with the active request. The patch simplifies blk_mq_tag_to_rq()
and ensures that the two requests are not active at the same time.
(BZ#1350352)

* The Hyper-V storage driver (storvsc) has been upgraded from
upstream. This update provides moderate performance improvement of I/O
operations when using storvscr for certain workloads. (BZ#1360161)

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security
impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each
vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security Fix(es) :

* A security flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the
mark_source_chains() function in 'net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c'. It
is possible for a user-supplied 'ipt_entry' structure to have a large
'next_offset' field. This field is not bounds checked prior to writing
to a counter value at the supplied offset. (CVE-2016-3134, Important)

* A flaw was discovered in processing setsockopt for 32 bit processes
on 64 bit systems. This flaw will allow attackers to alter arbitrary
kernel memory when unloading a kernel module. This action is usually
restricted to root-privileged users but can also be leveraged if the
kernel is compiled with CONFIG_USER_NS and CONFIG_NET_NS and the user
is granted elevated privileges. (CVE-2016-4997, Important)

* An out-of-bounds heap memory access leading to a Denial of Service,
heap disclosure, or further impact was found in setsockopt(). The
function call is normally restricted to root, however some processes
with cap_sys_admin may also be able to trigger this flaw in privileged
container environments. (CVE-2016-4998, Moderate)

Bug Fix(es) :

* In some cases, running the ipmitool command caused a kernel panic
due to a race condition in the ipmi message handler. This update fixes
the race condition, and the kernel panic no longer occurs in the
described scenario. (BZ#1353947)

* Previously, running I/O-intensive operations in some cases caused
the system to terminate unexpectedly after a NULL pointer dereference
in the kernel. With this update, a set of patches has been applied to
the 3w-9xxx and 3w-sas drivers that fix this bug. As a result, the
system no longer crashes in the described scenario. (BZ#1362040)

* Previously, the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) sockets
did not inherit the SELinux labels properly. As a consequence, the
sockets were labeled with the unlabeled_t SELinux type which caused
SCTP connections to fail. The underlying source code has been
modified, and SCTP connections now works as expected. (BZ#1354302)

* Previously, the bnx2x driver waited for transmission completions
when recovering from a parity event, which substantially increased the
recovery time. With this update, bnx2x does not wait for transmission
completion in the described circumstances. As a result, the recovery
of bnx2x after a parity event now takes less time. (BZ#1351972)

Enhancement(s) :

* With this update, the audit subsystem enables filtering of processes
by name besides filtering by PID. Users can now audit by executable
name (with the '-F exe=' option), which allows expression of many new
audit rules. This functionality can be used to create events when
specific applications perform a syscall. (BZ#1345774)

* With this update, the Nonvolatile Memory Express (NVMe) and the
multi-queue block layer (blk_mq) have been upgraded to the Linux 4.5
upstream version. Previously, a race condition between timeout and
freeing request in blk_mq occurred, which could affect the
blk_mq_tag_to_rq() function and consequently a kernel oops could
occur. The provided patch fixes this race condition by updating the
tags with the active request. The patch simplifies blk_mq_tag_to_rq()
and ensures that the two requests are not active at the same time.
(BZ#1350352)

* The Hyper-V storage driver (storvsc) has been upgraded from
upstream. This update provides moderate performance improvement of I/O
operations when using storvscr for certain workloads. (BZ#1360161)

vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as a
full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.

Security Fix(es) :

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status
request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker
could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount
of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all
available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)

* It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always use constant time
operations when computing Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
signatures. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain a
private DSA key belonging to another user or service running on the
same system. (CVE-2016-2178)

* It was discovered that the Datagram TLS (DTLS) implementation could
fail to release memory in certain cases. A malicious DTLS client could
cause a DTLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of
memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available
memory. (CVE-2016-2179)

* A flaw was found in the Datagram TLS (DTLS) replay protection
implementation in OpenSSL. A remote attacker could possibly use this
flaw to make a DTLS server using OpenSSL to reject further packets
sent from a DTLS client over an established DTLS connection.
(CVE-2016-2181)

* An out of bounds write flaw was discovered in the OpenSSL
BN_bn2dec() function. An attacker able to make an application using
OpenSSL to process a large BIGNUM could cause the application to crash
or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2182)

* A flaw was found in the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the
TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to
recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted
traffic between TLS/ SSL server and client if the communication used a
DES/3DES based ciphersuite. (CVE-2016-2183)

This update mitigates the CVE-2016-2183 issue by lowering priority of
DES cipher suites so they are not preferred over cipher suites using
AES. For compatibility reasons, DES cipher suites remain enabled by
default and included in the set of cipher suites identified by the
HIGH cipher string. Future updates may move them to MEDIUM or not
enable them by default.

* An integer underflow flaw leading to a buffer over-read was found in
the way OpenSSL parsed TLS session tickets. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to crash a TLS server using OpenSSL if it used SHA-512
as HMAC for session tickets. (CVE-2016-6302)

* Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way OpenSSL
performed pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use
these flaws to cause a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL to
crash. (CVE-2016-2177)

* An out of bounds read flaw was found in the way OpenSSL formatted
Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol data for printing. An
attacker could possibly cause an application using OpenSSL to crash if
it printed time stamp data from the attacker. (CVE-2016-2180)

* Multiple out of bounds read flaws were found in the way OpenSSL
handled certain TLS/SSL protocol handshake messages. A remote attacker
could possibly use these flaws to crash a TLS/SSL server or client

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as a
full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.

Security Fix(es) :

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status
request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker
could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount
of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all
available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)

* It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always use constant time
operations when computing Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
signatures. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain a
private DSA key belonging to another user or service running on the
same system. (CVE-2016-2178)

* It was discovered that the Datagram TLS (DTLS) implementation could
fail to release memory in certain cases. A malicious DTLS client could
cause a DTLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of
memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available
memory. (CVE-2016-2179)

* A flaw was found in the Datagram TLS (DTLS) replay protection
implementation in OpenSSL. A remote attacker could possibly use this
flaw to make a DTLS server using OpenSSL to reject further packets
sent from a DTLS client over an established DTLS connection.
(CVE-2016-2181)

* An out of bounds write flaw was discovered in the OpenSSL
BN_bn2dec() function. An attacker able to make an application using
OpenSSL to process a large BIGNUM could cause the application to crash
or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2182)

* A flaw was found in the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the
TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to
recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted
traffic between TLS/ SSL server and client if the communication used a
DES/3DES based ciphersuite. (CVE-2016-2183)

This update mitigates the CVE-2016-2183 issue by lowering priority of
DES cipher suites so they are not preferred over cipher suites using
AES. For compatibility reasons, DES cipher suites remain enabled by

* An integer underflow flaw leading to a buffer over-read was found in
the way OpenSSL parsed TLS session tickets. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to crash a TLS server using OpenSSL if it used SHA-512
as HMAC for session tickets. (CVE-2016-6302)

* Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way OpenSSL
performed pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use
these flaws to cause a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL to
crash. (CVE-2016-2177)

* An out of bounds read flaw was found in the way OpenSSL formatted
Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol data for printing. An
attacker could possibly cause an application using OpenSSL to crash if
it printed time stamp data from the attacker. (CVE-2016-2180)

* Multiple out of bounds read flaws were found in the way OpenSSL
handled certain TLS/SSL protocol handshake messages. A remote attacker
could possibly use these flaws to crash a TLS/SSL server or client

languages, such as C++, Python, or Pike, in applications like lsh or
GnuPG, or even in kernel space.

Security Fix(es) :

* Multiple flaws were found in the way nettle implemented elliptic
curve scalar multiplication. These flaws could potentially introduce
cryptographic weaknesses into nettle's functionality. (CVE-2015-8803,
CVE-2015-8804, CVE-2015-8805)

* It was found that nettle's RSA and DSA decryption code was
vulnerable to cache-related side channel attacks. An attacker could
use this flaw to recover the private key from a co-located
virtual-machine instance. (CVE-2016-6489)

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that
allows individual devices on an IP network to get their own network
configuration information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and
a broadcast address. The dhcp packages provide a relay agent and ISC
DHCP service required to enable and administer DHCP on a network.

Security Fix(es) :

* A resource-consumption flaw was discovered in the DHCP server. dhcpd
did not restrict the number of open connections to OMAPI and failover
ports. A remote attacker able to establish TCP connections to one of
these ports could use this flaw to cause dhcpd to exit unexpectedly,

Security Fix(es) :

* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in MIT Kerberos kadmind
service. An authenticated attacker with permission to modify a
principal entry could use this flaw to cause kadmind to dereference a
NULL pointer and crash by supplying an empty DB argument to the
modify_principal command, if kadmind was configured to use the LDAP
KDB module. (CVE-2016-3119)

The sudo packages contain the sudo utility which allows system
administrators to provide certain users with the permission to execute
privileged commands, which are used for system management purposes,
without having to log in as root.

Security Fix(es) :

* It was discovered that the default sudo configuration preserved the
value of INPUTRC from the user's environment, which could lead to
information disclosure. A local user with sudo access to a restricted

specially formatted files with elevated privileges provided by sudo.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

These updated kernel packages include several security issues and
numerous bug fixes, some of which you can see below. Space precludes
documenting all of these bug fixes in this advisory. To see the
complete list of bug fixes, users are directed to the related
Knowledge Article: https://access.redhat.com/ articles/2857831.

Security Fix(es) :

* A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the kernel's socket
recvmmsg subsystem. This may allow remote attackers to corrupt memory
and may allow execution of arbitrary code. This corruption takes place
during the error handling routines within __sys_recvmmsg() function.
(CVE-2016-7117, Important)

* A use-after-free vulnerability was found in
tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue and other tcp_* functions. This condition
could allow an attacker to send an incorrect selective acknowledgment
to existing connections, possibly resetting a connection.
(CVE-2016-6828, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of the SCTP
protocol. A remote attacker could trigger an out-of-bounds read with
an offset of up to 64kB potentially causing the system to crash.
(CVE-2016-9555, Moderate)

Bug Fix(es) :

* Previously, the performance of Internet Protocol over InfiniBand
(IPoIB) was suboptimal due to a conflict of IPoIB with the Generic
Receive Offload (GRO) infrastructure. With this update, the data
cached by the IPoIB driver has been moved from a control block into
the IPoIB hard header, thus avoiding the GRO problem and the
corruption of IPoIB address information. As a result, the performance
of IPoIB has been improved. (BZ#1390668)

* Previously, when a virtual machine (VM) with PCI-Passthrough
interfaces was recreated, a race condition between the eventfd daemon
and the virqfd daemon occurred. Consequently, the operating system
rebooted. This update fixes the race condition. As a result, the
operating system no longer reboots in the described situation.
(BZ#1391611)

* Previously, a packet loss occurred when the team driver in
round-robin mode was sending a large number of packets. This update
fixes counting of the packets in the round-robin runner of the team
driver, and the packet loss no longer occurs in the described
situation. (BZ#1392023)

* Previously, the virtual network devices contained in the deleted
namespace could be deleted in any order. If the loopback device was
not deleted as the last item, other netns devices, such as vxlan
devices, could end up with dangling references to the loopback device.
Consequently, deleting a network namespace (netns) occasionally ended
by a kernel oops. With this update, the underlying source code has
been fixed to ensure the correct order when deleting the virtual
network devices on netns deletion. As a result, the kernel oops no
longer occurs under the described circumstances. (BZ#1392024)

* Previously, a Kabylake system with a Sunrise Point Platform
Controller Hub (PCH) with a PCI device ID of 0xA149 showed the
following warning messages during the boot :

'Unknown Intel PCH (0xa149) detected.' 'Warning: Intel Kabylake
processor with unknown PCH - this hardware has not undergone testing
by Red Hat and might not be certified. Please consult https:/
/hardware.redhat.com for certified hardware.'

The messages were shown because this PCH was not properly recognized.
With this update, the problem has been fixed, and the operating system
now boots without displaying the warning messages. (BZ#1392033)

* Previously, the operating system occasionally became unresponsive
after a long run. This was caused by a race condition between the
try_to_wake_up() function and a woken up task in the core scheduler.
With this update, the race condition has been fixed, and the operating
system no longer locks up in the described scenario. (BZ#1393719)","Update the affected kernel packages.","http://www.nessus.org/u?ae4ff044","

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security Fix(es) :

* Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine
(CONFIG_KVM) support is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference flaw.
It could occur on x86 platform, when emulating an undefined
instruction. An attacker could use this flaw to crash the host kernel
resulting in DoS. (CVE-2016-8630, Important)

* A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in
the way the raw packet sockets implementation in the Linux kernel
networking subsystem handled synchronization while creating the
TPACKET_V3 ring buffer. A local user able to open a raw packet socket
(requires the CAP_NET_RAW capability) could use this flaw to elevate
their privileges on the system. (CVE-2016-8655, Important)

* A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's implementation of VFIO.
An attacker issuing an ioctl can create a situation where memory is
corrupted and modify memory outside of the expected area. This may
overwrite kernel memory and subvert kernel execution. (CVE-2016-9083,
Important)

* The use of a kzalloc with an integer multiplication allowed an
integer overflow condition to be reached in vfio_pci_intrs.c. This
combined with CVE-2016-9083 may allow an attacker to craft an attack
and use unallocated memory, potentially crashing the machine.
(CVE-2016-9084, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Philip Pettersson for reporting
CVE-2016-8655.

[Updated 16 June 2017] The packages distributed with this errata have
a bug that can cause the rpcbind utility to terminate unexpectedly at
start. RHBA-2017:1436 was released on 13 June 2017 to address this
issue.

The rpcbind utility is a server that converts Remote Procedure Call
(RPC) program numbers into universal addresses. It must be running on
the host to be able to make RPC calls on a server on that machine.

Security Fix(es) :

* It was found that due to the way rpcbind uses libtirpc (libntirpc),
a memory leak can occur when parsing specially crafted XDR messages.
An attacker sending thousands of messages to rpcbind could cause its
memory usage to grow without bound, eventually causing it to be
terminated by the OOM killer. (CVE-2017-8779)","Update the affected rpcbind package.","http://www.nessus.org/u?39639b81","

use this flaw to trigger a buffer overflow, resulting in the crash of
the system. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot

* Mounting a crafted EXT4 image read-only leads to an attacker
controlled memory corruption and SLAB-Out-of-Bounds reads.
(CVE-2016-10208, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of seq_file
where a local attacker could manipulate memory in the put() function
pointer. This could lead to memory corruption and possible privileged

* A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local
user could trigger oops in shash_async_export() by attempting to force
the in-kernel hashing algorithms into decrypting an empty data set.
(CVE-2016-8646, Moderate)

* It was reported that with Linux kernel, earlier than version
v4.10-rc8, an application may trigger a BUG_ON in sctp_wait_for_sndbuf

mitigation which increases the stack guard gap size from one page to 1
MiB to make successful exploitation of this issue more difficult.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security Fix(es) :

* A flaw was found in the way Linux kernel allocates heap memory to
build the scattergather list from a fragment
list(skb_shinfo(skb)->frag_list) in the socket buffer(skb_buff). The
heap overflow occurred if 'MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1' parameter and
'NETIF_F_FRAGLIST' feature were used together. A remote user or

a system. (CVE-2017-7477, Important)

* The NFS2/3 RPC client could send long arguments to the NFS server.
These encoded arguments are stored in an array of memory pages, and
accessed using pointer variables. Arbitrarily long arguments could
make these pointers point outside the array and cause an out-of-bounds
memory access. A remote user or program could use this flaw to crash
the kernel (denial of service). (CVE-2017-7645, Important)

* The NFSv2 and NFSv3 server implementations in the Linux kernel
through 4.10.13 lacked certain checks for the end of a buffer. A
remote attacker could trigger a pointer-arithmetic error or possibly
cause other unspecified impacts using crafted requests related to
fs/nfsd/nfs3xdr.c and fs/nfsd/nfsxdr.c. (CVE-2017-7895, Important)

* The Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine
(CONFIG_KVM) support was vulnerable to an incorrect segment
selector(SS) value error. The error could occur while loading values
into the SS register in long mode. A user or process inside a guest
could use this flaw to crash the guest, resulting in DoS or
potentially escalate their privileges inside the guest.
(CVE-2017-2583, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handling of packets with the
URG flag. Applications using the splice() and tcp_splice_read()
functionality could allow a remote attacker to force the kernel to
enter a condition in which it could loop indefinitely. (CVE-2017-6214,
Moderate)

Bug Fix(es) :

* Previously, the reserved-pages counter (HugePages_Rsvd) was bigger
than the total-pages counter (HugePages_Total) in the /proc/meminfo
file, and HugePages_Rsvd underflowed. With this update, the HugeTLB
feature of the Linux kernel has been fixed, and HugePages_Rsvd
underflow no longer occurs. (BZ#1445184)

* If a directory on a NFS client was modified while being listed, the
NFS client could restart the directory listing multiple times.
Consequently, the performance of listing the directory was
sub-optimal. With this update, the restarting of the directory listing
happens less frequently. As a result, the performance of listing the
directory while it is being modified has improved. (BZ#1450851)

* The Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) adapter in some cases failed
to reboot. This update fixes the qla2xxx driver, and FCoE adapter now
reboots as expected. (BZ#1446246)

* When a VM with Virtual Function I/O (VFIO) device was rebooted, the
QEMU process occasionally terminated unexpectedly due to a failed VFIO
Direct Memory Access (DMA) map request. This update fixes the vfio
driver and QEMU no longer crashes in the described situation.
(BZ#1450855)

* When the operating system was booted with the in-box lpfc driver, a
kernel panic occurred on the little-endian variant of IBM Power
Systems. This update fixes lpfc, and the kernel no longer panics in
the described situation. (BZ#1452044)

* When creating or destroying a VM with Virtual Function I/O (VFIO)
devices with 'Hugepages' feature enabled, errors in Direct Memory
Access (DMA) page table entry (PTE) mappings occurred, and QEMU memory
usage behaved unpredictably. This update fixes range computation when
making room for large pages in Input/Output Memory Management Unit
(IOMMU). As a result, errors in DMA PTE mappings no longer occur, and
QEMU has a predictable memory usage in the described situation.

to reboot. This update fixes the qla2xxx driver, and FCoE adapter now
reboots as expected. (BZ#1446246)

* When a VM with Virtual Function I/O (VFIO) device was rebooted, the
QEMU process occasionally terminated unexpectedly due to a failed VFIO
Direct Memory Access (DMA) map request. This update fixes the vfio
driver and QEMU no longer crashes in the described situation.
(BZ#1450855)

* When the operating system was booted with the in-box lpfc driver, a
kernel panic occurred on the little-endian variant of IBM Power
Systems. This update fixes lpfc, and the kernel no longer panics in
the described situation. (BZ#1452044)

* When creating or destroying a VM with Virtual Function I/O (VFIO)
devices with 'Hugepages' feature enabled, errors in Direct Memory
Access (DMA) page table entry (PTE) mappings occurred, and QEMU memory
usage behaved unpredictably. This update fixes range computation when
making room for large pages in Input/Output Memory Management Unit
(IOMMU). As a result, errors in DMA PTE mappings no longer occur, and
QEMU has a predictable memory usage in the described situation.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security
impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each
vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security Fix(es) :

* An use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel which enables a
race condition in the L2TPv3 IP Encapsulation feature. A local user
could use this flaw to escalate their privileges or crash the system.
(CVE-2016-10200, Important)

* A flaw was found that can be triggered in keyring_search_iterator in
keyring.c if type->match is NULL. A local user could use this flaw to
crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges.
(CVE-2017-2647, Important)

* It was found that the NFSv4 server in the Linux kernel did not
properly validate layout type when processing NFSv4 pNFS LAYOUTGET and
GETDEVICEINFO operands. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
soft-lockup the system and thus cause denial of service.
(CVE-2017-8797, Important)

OpenLDAP is an open source suite of Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP) applications and development tools. LDAP is a set of
protocols used to access and maintain distributed directory
information services over an IP network. The openldap packages contain
configuration files, libraries, and documentation for OpenLDAP.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version:
openldap (2.4.44). (BZ#1386365)

Security Fix(es) :

* A double-free flaw was found in the way OpenLDAP's slapd server
using the MDB backend handled LDAP searches. A remote attacker with
access to search the directory could potentially use this flaw to
crash slapd by issuing a specially crafted LDAP search query.

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language, which includes modules, classes, exceptions, very high level
dynamic data types and dynamic typing. Python supports interfaces to
many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing
systems.

Security Fix(es) :

* The Python standard library HTTP client modules (such as httplib or
urllib) did not perform verification of TLS/SSL certificates when
connecting to HTTPS servers. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use
this flaw to hijack connections and eavesdrop or modify transferred
data. (CVE-2014-9365)

MariaDB is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server that is
binary compatible with MySQL.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version:
mariadb (5.5.56). (BZ#1458933)

Security Fix(es) :

* It was discovered that the mysql and mysqldump tools did not
correctly handle database and table names containing newline
characters. A database user with privileges to create databases or
tables could cause the mysql command to execute arbitrary shell or SQL
commands while restoring database backup created using the mysqldump
tool. (CVE-2016-5483, CVE-2017-3600)

* A flaw was found in the way the mysqld_safe script handled creation
of error log file. The mysql operating system user could use this flaw
to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2016-5617, CVE-2016-6664)

* Multiple flaws were found in the way the MySQL init script handled
initialization of the database data directory and permission setting
on the error log file. The mysql operating system user could use these
flaws to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2017-3265)

* It was discovered that the mysqld_safe script honored the ledir
option value set in a MySQL configuration file. A user able to modify
one of the MySQL configuration files could use this flaw to escalate
their privileges to root. (CVE-2017-3291)

* Multiple flaws were found in the way the mysqld_safe script handled
creation of error log file. The mysql operating system user could use
these flaws to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2017-3312)

* A flaw was found in the way MySQL client library (libmysqlclient)
handled prepared statements when server connection was lost. A
malicious server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could possibly use
this flaw to crash an application using libmysqlclient.
(CVE-2017-3302)

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux

Security Fix(es) :

* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the
Bluetooth subsystem of the Linux kernel processed pending L2CAP
configuration responses from a client. On systems with the stack
protection feature enabled in the kernel (CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR=y,
which is enabled on all architectures other than s390x and ppc64[le]),
an unauthenticated attacker able to initiate a connection to a system
via Bluetooth could use this flaw to crash the system. Due to the
nature of the stack protection feature, code execution cannot be fully
ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely. On systems without the
stack protection feature (ppc64[le]; the Bluetooth modules are not
built on s390x), an unauthenticated attacker able to initiate a

Security Fix(es) :

* A heap buffer overflow was found in dnsmasq in the code responsible
for building DNS replies. An attacker could send crafted DNS packets
to dnsmasq which would cause it to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-14491)

* A heap buffer overflow was discovered in dnsmasq in the IPv6 router
advertisement (RA) handling code. An attacker on the local network
segment could send crafted RAs to dnsmasq which would cause it to
crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. This issue only
affected configurations using one of these options: enable-ra,

* An information leak was found in dnsmasq in the DHCPv6 relay code.
An attacker on the local network could send crafted DHCPv6 packets to
dnsmasq causing it to forward the contents of process memory,
potentially leaking sensitive data. (CVE-2017-14494)

* A memory exhaustion flaw was found in dnsmasq in the EDNS0 code. An
attacker could send crafted DNS packets which would trigger memory
allocations which would never be freed, leading to unbounded memory
consumption and eventually a crash. This issue only affected
configurations using one of the options: add-mac, add-cpe-id, or

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security Fix(es) :

* Out-of-bounds kernel heap access vulnerability was found in xfrm,
kernel's IP framework for transforming packets. An error dealing with
netlink messages from an unprivileged user leads to arbitrary
read/write and privilege escalation. (CVE-2017-7184, Important)

* A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in
the way the raw packet sockets are implemented in the Linux kernel
networking subsystem handling synchronization. A local user able to
open a raw packet socket (requires the CAP_NET_RAW capability) could
use this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2017-1000111, Important)

* An exploitable memory corruption flaw was found in the Linux kernel.
The append path can be erroneously switched from UFO to non-UFO in
ip_ufo_append_data() when building an UFO packet with MSG_MORE option.
If unprivileged user namespaces are available, this flaw can be
exploited to gain root privileges. (CVE-2017-1000112, Important)

* A flaw was found in the Linux networking subsystem where a local
attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities could cause an out-of-bounds
memory access by creating a smaller-than-expected ICMP header and
sending to its destination via sendto(). (CVE-2016-8399, Moderate)

* Kernel memory corruption due to a buffer overflow was found in
brcmf_cfg80211_mgmt_tx() function in Linux kernels from v3.9-rc1 to
v4.13-rc1. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted
NL80211_CMD_FRAME packet via netlink. This flaw is unlikely to be
triggered remotely as certain userspace code is needed for this. An
unprivileged local user could use this flaw to induce kernel memory
corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the
flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although it is
unlikely. (CVE-2017-7541, Moderate)

* An integer overflow vulnerability in ip6_find_1stfragopt() function
was found. A local attacker that has privileges (of CAP_NET_RAW) to
open raw socket can cause an infinite loop inside the
ip6_find_1stfragopt() function. (CVE-2017-7542, Moderate)

* A kernel data leak due to an out-of-bound read was found in the
Linux kernel in inet_diag_msg_sctp{,l}addr_fill() and
sctp_get_sctp_info() functions present since version 4.7-rc1 through
version 4.13. A data leak happens when these functions fill in
sockaddr data structures used to export socket's diagnostic
information. As a result, up to 100 bytes of the slab data could be
leaked to a userspace. (CVE-2017-7558, Moderate)

* The mq_notify function in the Linux kernel through 4.11.9 does not
set the sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. During a
user-space close of a Netlink socket, it allows attackers to possibly
cause a situation where a value may be used after being freed
(use-after-free) which may lead to memory corruption or other
unspecified other impact. (CVE-2017-11176, Moderate)

* A divide-by-zero vulnerability was found in the __tcp_select_window
function in the Linux kernel. This can result in a kernel panic
causing a local denial of service. (CVE-2017-14106, Moderate)

netlink messages from an unprivileged user leads to arbitrary
read/write and privilege escalation. (CVE-2017-7184, Important)

* A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in
the way the raw packet sockets are implemented in the Linux kernel
networking subsystem handling synchronization. A local user able to
open a raw packet socket (requires the CAP_NET_RAW capability) could
use this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2017-1000111, Important)

* An exploitable memory corruption flaw was found in the Linux kernel.
The append path can be erroneously switched from UFO to non-UFO in
ip_ufo_append_data() when building an UFO packet with MSG_MORE option.
If unprivileged user namespaces are available, this flaw can be
exploited to gain root privileges. (CVE-2017-1000112, Important)

* A flaw was found in the Linux networking subsystem where a local
attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities could cause an out-of-bounds
memory access by creating a smaller-than-expected ICMP header and
sending to its destination via sendto(). (CVE-2016-8399, Moderate)

* Kernel memory corruption due to a buffer overflow was found in
brcmf_cfg80211_mgmt_tx() function in Linux kernels from v3.9-rc1 to
v4.13-rc1. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted
NL80211_CMD_FRAME packet via netlink. This flaw is unlikely to be
triggered remotely as certain userspace code is needed for this. An
unprivileged local user could use this flaw to induce kernel memory
corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the
flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although it is
unlikely. (CVE-2017-7541, Moderate)

* An integer overflow vulnerability in ip6_find_1stfragopt() function
was found. A local attacker that has privileges (of CAP_NET_RAW) to
open raw socket can cause an infinite loop inside the
ip6_find_1stfragopt() function. (CVE-2017-7542, Moderate)

* A kernel data leak due to an out-of-bound read was found in the
Linux kernel in inet_diag_msg_sctp{,l}addr_fill() and
sctp_get_sctp_info() functions present since version 4.7-rc1 through
version 4.13. A data leak happens when these functions fill in
sockaddr data structures used to export socket's diagnostic
information. As a result, up to 100 bytes of the slab data could be
leaked to a userspace. (CVE-2017-7558, Moderate)

* The mq_notify function in the Linux kernel through 4.11.9 does not
set the sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. During a
user-space close of a Netlink socket, it allows attackers to possibly
cause a situation where a value may be used after being freed
(use-after-free) which may lead to memory corruption or other
unspecified other impact. (CVE-2017-11176, Moderate)

* A divide-by-zero vulnerability was found in the __tcp_select_window
function in the Linux kernel. This can result in a kernel panic
causing a local denial of service. (CVE-2017-14106, Moderate)

Security Fix(es) :

* It was found that the timer functionality in the Linux kernel ALSA
subsystem is prone to a race condition between read and ioctl system
call handlers, resulting in an uninitialized memory disclosure to user
space. A local user could use this flaw to read information belonging
to other users. (CVE-2017-1000380, Moderate)

penalty. Please refer to References section for further information
about this issue and the performance impact.

In this update initial mitigations for IBM Power (PowerPC) and IBM
zSeries (S390) architectures are provided.

* Variant CVE-2017-5715 triggers the speculative execution by
utilizing branch target injection. It relies on the presence of a
precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well
as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the
microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed
instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an
unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall and
guest/host boundaries and read privileged memory by conducting
targeted cache side-channel attacks. This fix specifically addresses
S390 processors. (CVE-2017-5715, Important)

* Variant CVE-2017-5753 triggers the speculative execution by
performing a bounds-check bypass. It relies on the presence of a
precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well
as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the
microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed
instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an
unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall
boundary and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache
side-channel attacks. This fix specifically addresses S390 and PowerPC
processors. (CVE-2017-5753, Important)

* Variant CVE-2017-5754 relies on the fact that, on impacted
microprocessors, during speculative execution of instruction
permission faults, exception generation triggered by a faulting access
is suppressed until the retirement of the whole instruction block. In
a combination with the fact that memory accesses may populate the
cache even when the block is being dropped and never committed
(executed), an unprivileged local attacker could use this flaw to read
privileged (kernel space) memory by conducting targeted cache
side-channel attacks. Note: CVE-2017-5754 affects Intel x86-64
microprocessors. AMD x86-64 microprocessors are not affected by this
issue. This fix specifically addresses PowerPC processors.

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that
allows individual devices on an IP network to get their own network
configuration information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and
a broadcast address. The dhcp packages provide a relay agent and ISC

Security Fix(es) :

* It was found that the DHCP daemon did not properly clean up closed
OMAPI connections in certain cases. A remote attacker able to connect
to the OMAPI port could use this flaw to exhaust file descriptors in
the DHCP daemon, leading to a denial of service in the OMAPI
functionality. (CVE-2017-3144)","Update the affected dhcp packages.","http://www.nessus.org/u?10bd2215","

The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for
Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides
aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation
for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps
track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports
snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and
automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional
dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in
replacement for sysvinit.

Security Fix(es) :

* A race condition was found in systemd. This could result in
automount requests not being serviced and processes using them could
hang, causing denial of service. (CVE-2018-1049)","Update the affected systemd packages.","http://www.nessus.org/u?3333da49","

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security Fix(es) :

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern
microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load
& Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It
relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in
the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address
to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and
subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even
for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit
(retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to
read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel
attacks. (CVE-2018-3639)

Note: This issue is present in hardware and cannot be fully fixed via
software update. The updated kernel packages provide software side of
the mitigation for this hardware issue. To be fully functional,
up-to-date CPU microcode applied on the system is required. Please
refer to References section for further information about this issue,
CPU microcode requirements and the potential performance impact.

In this update mitigations for x86-64 architecture are provided.

credentials. No issues were reported with access, privilege, or
intermittent failure.","Valid credentials were provided for an authentication protocol on the
remote target and Nessus did not log any subsequent errors or failures
for the authentication protocol.

When possible, Nessus tracks errors or failures related to otherwise
valid credentials in order to highlight issues that may result in
incomplete scan results or limited scan coverage. The types of issues
that are tracked include errors that indicate that the account used
for scanning did not have sufficient permissions for a particular
check, intermittent protocol failures which are unexpected after the
protocol has been negotiated successfully earlier in the scan, and
intermittent authentication failures which are unexpected after a
credential set has been accepted as valid earlier in the scan. This
plugin reports when none of the above issues have been logged during
the course of the scan for at least one authenticated protocol. See
plugin output for details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  issues to be encountered for one protocol and not another.
  For example, authentication to the SSH service on the
  remote target may have consistently succeeded with no
  privilege errors encountered, while connections to the SMB
  service on the remote target may have failed
  intermittently.

- Resolving logged issues for all available authentication
  protocols may improve scan coverage, but the value of
  resolving each issue for a particular protocol may vary
  from target to target depending upon what data (if any) is
  gathered from the target via that protocol and what
  particular check failed. For example, consistently
  successful checks via SSH are more critical for Linux
  targets than for Windows targets, and likewise
  consistently successful checks via SMB are more critical
  for Windows targets than for Linux targets.","n/a","","

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security
impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each
vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security Fix(es) :

* Modern operating systems implement virtualization of physical memory
to efficiently use available system resources and provide inter-domain
protection through access control and isolation. The L1TF issue was
found in the way the x86 microprocessor designs have implemented
speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance
optimisation) in combination with handling of page-faults caused by
terminated virtual to physical address resolving process. As a result,
an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory
of the kernel or other processes and/or cross guest/host boundaries to
read host memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks.
(CVE-2018-3620, CVE-2018-3646)

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern
microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of
instructions past bounds check. The flaw relies on the presence of a
precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code and the
fact that memory writes occur to an address which depends on the
untrusted value. Such writes cause an update into the microprocessor's
data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never
actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could
use this flaw to influence speculative execution and/or read
privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks.
(CVE-2018-3693)

* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel
handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to
tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() and tcp_prune_ofo_queue() functions by
sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which
could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the
system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires
continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the
attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses.
(CVE-2018-5390)

* kernel: crypto: privilege escalation in skcipher_recvmsg function
(CVE-2017-13215)

* kernel: mm: use-after-free in do_get_mempolicy function allows local

to efficiently use available system resources and provide inter-domain
protection through access control and isolation. The L1TF issue was
found in the way the x86 microprocessor designs have implemented
speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance
optimisation) in combination with handling of page-faults caused by
terminated virtual to physical address resolving process. As a result,
an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory
of the kernel or other processes and/or cross guest/host boundaries to
read host memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks.
(CVE-2018-3620, CVE-2018-3646)

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern
microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of
instructions past bounds check. The flaw relies on the presence of a
precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code and the
fact that memory writes occur to an address which depends on the
untrusted value. Such writes cause an update into the microprocessor's
data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never
actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could
use this flaw to influence speculative execution and/or read
privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks.
(CVE-2018-3693)

* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel
handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to
tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() and tcp_prune_ofo_queue() functions by
sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which
could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the
system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires
continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the
attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses.
(CVE-2018-5390)

* kernel: crypto: privilege escalation in skcipher_recvmsg function
(CVE-2017-13215)

* kernel: mm: use-after-free in do_get_mempolicy function allows local
DoS or other unspecified impact (CVE-2018-10675)

* kernel: race condition in snd_seq_write() may lead to UAF or OOB
access (CVE-2018-7566)

Bug Fix(es) :

* Previously, the mysqladmin tool waited for an inadequate length of
time if the socket it listened on did not respond in a specific way.

Bug Fix(es) :

* Previously, the mysqladmin tool waited for an inadequate length of
time if the socket it listened on did not respond in a specific way.
Consequently, when the socket was used while the MariaDB server was
starting, the mariadb service became unresponsive for a long time.
With this update, the mysqladmin timeout has been shortened to 2
seconds. As a result, the mariadb service either starts or fails but
no longer hangs in the described situation. (BZ#1584023)","Update the affected mariadb packages.","http://www.nessus.org/u?f416f9e0","

Bug Fix(es) :

* Previously, the mysqladmin tool waited for an inadequate length of
time if the socket it listened on did not respond in a specific way.
Consequently, when the socket was used while the MariaDB server was
starting, the mariadb service became unresponsive for a long time.
With this update, the mysqladmin timeout has been shortened to 2
seconds. As a result, the mariadb service either starts or fails but
no longer hangs in the described situation. (BZ#1584023)","Update the affected mariadb packages.","http://www.nessus.org/u?f416f9e0","

Bug Fix(es) :

* Previously, the mysqladmin tool waited for an inadequate length of
time if the socket it listened on did not respond in a specific way.
Consequently, when the socket was used while the MariaDB server was
starting, the mariadb service became unresponsive for a long time.
With this update, the mysqladmin timeout has been shortened to 2
seconds. As a result, the mariadb service either starts or fails but
no longer hangs in the described situation. (BZ#1584023)","Update the affected mariadb packages.","http://www.nessus.org/u?f416f9e0","

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security Fix(es) :

* A flaw was found in the implementation of the 'fill buffer', a
mechanism used by modern CPUs when a cache-miss is made on L1 CPU
cache. If an attacker can generate a load operation that would create
a page fault, the execution will continue speculatively with incorrect
data from the fill buffer while the data is fetched from higher level
caches. This response time can be measured to infer data in the fill
buffer. (CVE-2018-12130)

* Modern Intel microprocessors implement hardware-level
micro-optimizations to improve the performance of writing data back to
CPU caches. The write operation is split into STA (STore Address) and
STD (STore Data) sub-operations. These sub-operations allow the
processor to hand-off address generation logic into these
sub-operations for optimized writes. Both of these sub-operations
write to a shared distributed processor structure called the
'processor store buffer'. As a result, an unprivileged attacker could
use this flaw to read private data resident within the CPU's processor
store buffer. (CVE-2018-12126)

* Microprocessors use a 'load port' subcomponent to perform load
operations from memory or IO. During a load operation, the load port
receives data from the memory or IO subsystem and then provides the
data to the CPU registers and operations in the CPU's pipelines.
Stale load operations results are stored in the 'load port' table
until overwritten by newer operations. Certain load-port operations
triggered by an attacker can be used to reveal data about previous
stale requests leaking data back to the attacker via a timing
side-channel. (CVE-2018-12127)

* Uncacheable memory on some microprocessors utilizing speculative
execution may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable
information disclosure via a side channel with local access.

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security Fix(es) :

* A flaw was found in the implementation of the 'fill buffer', a
mechanism used by modern CPUs when a cache-miss is made on L1 CPU
cache. If an attacker can generate a load operation that would create
a page fault, the execution will continue speculatively with incorrect
data from the fill buffer while the data is fetched from higher level
caches. This response time can be measured to infer data in the fill
buffer. (CVE-2018-12130)

* Modern Intel microprocessors implement hardware-level
micro-optimizations to improve the performance of writing data back to
CPU caches. The write operation is split into STA (STore Address) and
STD (STore Data) sub-operations. These sub-operations allow the
processor to hand-off address generation logic into these
sub-operations for optimized writes. Both of these sub-operations
write to a shared distributed processor structure called the
'processor store buffer'. As a result, an unprivileged attacker could
use this flaw to read private data resident within the CPU's processor
store buffer. (CVE-2018-12126)

* Microprocessors use a 'load port' subcomponent to perform load
operations from memory or IO. During a load operation, the load port
receives data from the memory or IO subsystem and then provides the
data to the CPU registers and operations in the CPU's pipelines.
Stale load operations results are stored in the 'load port' table
until overwritten by newer operations. Certain load-port operations
triggered by an attacker can be used to reveal data about previous
stale requests leaking data back to the attacker via a timing
side-channel. (CVE-2018-12127)

* Uncacheable memory on some microprocessors utilizing speculative
execution may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable
information disclosure via a side channel with local access.

* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's
networking subsystem processed TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK)
segments. While processing SACK segments, the Linux kernel's socket

an authentication protocol available on the remote target because it
was able to successfully authenticate directly to the remote target
using that authentication protocol at least once. Authentication was
successful because the authentication protocol service was available
remotely, the service was able to be identified, the authentication
protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of
credentials provided in the scan policy for that authentication
protocol was accepted by the remote service. See plugin output for
details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","
